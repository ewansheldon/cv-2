A junior software developer, often found cracking edge cases, nesting callbacks and scouring docs for matchers.

I decided to pursue programming after becoming fascinated by how technology can be used to solve the world’s inefficiencies through a combination of creative and technical means.

Having successfully applied to [Makers Academy](http://makersacademy.com), Europe’s leading developer bootcamp, I took the leap from digital-savvy early-adopter to innovative engineer and I’ve found an endless source of learning on the other side.

## SKILLS

**Initiative**

I am proactive when it comes to finding ways to improve productivity and increase value. In my former role, I'd regularly pitch ideas to brands and successfully produced partnerships with multinationals, including Warner Music Group and Illva Saronno. Identifying such opportunities continues to benefit me as I seek ways to bring value to my teammates and pitch ideas at hackathons. Most recently, I successfully pitched a web application that would track novice coders' confidence in key skills, identify weaknesses and send a weekly email with related content from the web.

**Team Work**

I love working in a team and pulling together on a project. While in my previous role for example, I was recognised for boosting team morale, as we powered through back to back projects in London, Paris, Milan, New York and Seoul. During these trips, each under a week-long, work was fast-paced and all-hours.

Besides that, I've a track record for going to lengths to ensure that the finished product best represents the extent of what my team can achieve, whether that requires working late nights and weekends, or foregoing my own ideas to get behind another's.

## PROJECTS
Project | Description | Technologies | Testing | Duration
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
[RoadtoCode](https://github.com/road-to-code/road-to-code) | Given a brief to build a game that would introduce children to the foundations of programming, our team of four junior developers made Road to Code - an interactive grid-based game that requires the player to get across a map by programming directions for their character to follow. Interested in the challenge, we decided against using any frameworks. Instead, we wrote each line of code ourselves and favoured vanilla JavaScript for our frontend. | JavaScript, Sinatra, PostgreSQL | Jasmine, Mocha, ZombieJS | 8 Days
[CodeyGonzalez](https://github.com/mjosephmiller/codey-gonzalez) | Participating in a three-day developer-tool hackathon, our team of five junior developers, aimed to improve coders' speed, accuracy and familiarity with best-practice formatting.  Defining our MVP early, we implemented agile development to deliver the product on time and to specification. Find it on [Heroku](http://codey-gonzalez.herokuapp.com/). | JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL | RSpec, Capybara, Poltergeist | 3 Days
[nodeAbode](https://github.com/mjosephmiller/makersbnb) | Tasked with creating an AirBnb clone in a team of three, we picked up and implemented a number of technologies that were not on the curriculum, including Node, Sequelize and ZombieJS | Node, Sequelize | ZombieJS | 4 Days

## INTERESTS

I'm a regular attendee on the meetup circuit (TwitterDev, Silicon Drinkabout and have even been
known to attend a Saturday morning Katathon). When I'm not debugging, refactoring or
otherwise getting to grips with the latest technologies, I love to get outdoors. I'm a keen swimmer
and a slightly less than enthusiastic runner, though I did struggle through the London Marathon this year -
*I'm nothing if not persevering.*
